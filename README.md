An IoT-enabled safety and automation system designed to detect gas leaks, monitor burner activity, and prevent fire hazards in smart kitchens. Built with ESP32 microcontrollers, MQ-5 gas sensors, flame sensors, and DHT11 modules, the system monitors environmental conditions and automatically sends real-time alerts via LCD display, buzzer, SMS, email, and mobile dashboard. It can also remotely control burner flow and automatically shut off the gas supply in emergency situationsâ€”enhancing safety, energy efficiency, and home automation reliability.
